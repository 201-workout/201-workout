# Pitch:  
* Picking workout tracker

-The workout tracker tracks individual's weekly/daily workouts to be performed as well as the required reps and sets of each exercise. Also includes a page that lists exercises and informs the user how to perform each   exercise.     
-This website helps to track an individual's progress from weight lifting to help keep that person motivated as well as to help not hit a plateau.  
-Have a home page that allows a user to add a workout/program from a different page and have that workout page be accessible from the home page.
